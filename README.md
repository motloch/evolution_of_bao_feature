# Show cosmological evolution of a point like overdensity (including a BAO feature)

Creates a video that captures cosmological evolution of an initially point-like overdensity. We assume the overdensity is adiabatic and show final profiles in cold dark matter, baryons, neutrinos and photons. The BAO feature is clearly visible.

Inspired by Fig. 1 from ['On the Robustness of the Acoustic Scale in the Low-Redshift
Clustering of Matter' by Daniel J. Eisenstein, Hee-Jong Seo and Martin White]

**Required:**
Python 3
FFTMPEG

**Usage:**

`./makevideo.sh`

**Output:**

The code creates images in folder "img", then combines them and creates a video "bao.mp4"
in the main folder.
